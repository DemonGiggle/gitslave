			       Gitslave
			     Release 2.0
			      2011-03-01



			     New Features


* Recursive subprojects

With the use of `gits attach --recursive=.gitslave URL DIRECTORY`
gitslave now fully support recursive subprojects (or slaves which are
themselves gitslave masters of yet more slaves).

* gitslave tutorial created

A tutorial was created which walks the reader through a from-scratch
repository creation using the most popular and needed git commands in
the multi-repository gitslave environment.  The tutorial and overall
gitslave website is now stored as part of gitslave.

* gits pulls more efficient and safer.

Gits pulls perform a pull on all available local branches.  This now should
perform only one fetch (in most cases).  Also --rebase is safer by
using --preserve-merges (in most cases).

* gits now implements paginated output by default, just like git

Pagination is only enabled if standard output is a tty (and there is a
controlling tty for the pager to take input from).  If you do not want
paginated output, the -n or --no-pager option disables it.  All the git
pager configuration settings (GIT_PAGER and PAGER environment variables,
and core.pager configuration setting) are honored.

* gits populate can now request population of specific ifpresent modules





		       Important Bugs Squashed


* Gitslave now supportes .gitignore management when adding a slave in
  a deep directory (gits attach ../foo plugins/foo).

* Gitslave generated .gitignore entries are now more precise.

* Gitslave no longer assumes we cloned onto the master branch.

* Gitslave support --fromcheckout with gits clone.

* Gitslave users can now decline hooks management (--nohooks)




			Critical Upgrade Notes


* The old saved setting of --fromcheckout has been forgotten.  There
  is a new configuration setting in town which will not cause
  confusion when `gits remotes` are used and some remotes have
  --fromcheckout and others are not.  This would only be important if
  someone attached a new repository and people needing --fromcheckout
  did a `gits populate`--in other words pretty unlikely.  Workaround,
  gits update-remote-url --fromcheckout <current URL>.

* Legacy gitslave added .gitignore values cannot be removed when
  subproject removed by detach.  The legacy gitslave entries in
  .gitignore were nonspecific (e.g. <directoryname>) so could match
  undesired files/directories elsewhere.  Gitslave now uses specific
  anchored entries (e.g. /directoryname/), but no method is provided
  to convert them.  This would only be important if someone detached
  an old repository and then replaced it with an embedded directory.
  Workaround, make the entries specific (/directoryname/) or manually
  delete them as needed.



		    Features or Bugs of Minor Note


* Gits resolve now takes optional "remote" name

* Gits update-remote-url now works with --no-master and
  some --exclude arguments.

* Gitslave prints "(last repository path component)" instead of "."
  for the top level repository.

* Gitslave now summarizes branch mismatch warnings.

* gits -v provides full output, -vv provides commands execute,
  -vvvv provide command status and output.

* Summarize last message "On:" header if there are many many entries.

* Gitslave correctly handles directory paths with whitespace in them, and
  will not execute commands in the wrong directory if it cannot chdir
