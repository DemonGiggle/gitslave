	* Fully support recursive subprojects with the
	--recursive=.gitslave argument to gits attach.  Important upgrade
	notes: --fromcheckout is now remote aware, so legacy
	--fromcheckout gitslave repositories will not be able to properly
	update-remote-url or populate using the saved --fromcheckout
	state.  Workaround, reclone or re-update-remote-url with an
	explicit --fromcheckout.  No auto-inheritance available because of
	multiple remotes contamination of the --fromcheckout setting.

	* Add extra optional (remote) argument for `gits resolve`
	(Previously hardcoded to origin).

	* Allow `gits update-remote-url` to work with --no-master and some
	--exclude arguments).

	* Bugfix: Do not assume we just cloned onto master branch

	* Bugfix: Allow --(no-)?fromcheckout to work with gits clone

	* Bugfix: Do not assume when setting git-hooks, that slave is
	shallow.  It may be in a subdirectory.

	* --nohooks on clone and populate to ask for no .git/hooks
	management by gitslave (if the super-repo asked for it)

	* Use $git more consistently

	* Support recursive subprojects (but only if the "master"
	subproject is relatively equivalent to the top-superproject.
	Relative URLs do not yet understand that they should be based off
	a new URL.

2011-02-18  Alex Dupuy  <alex.dupuy@mac.com>

	* split up "pulls" commands so that fetch is performed only once
	for each repository (in most cases)

	* make pulls --rebase safer by using --preserve-merges (in most cases)

	* make pulls work in current (top-level) branch first

	* run check for git-hooks in master only once for each repository

	* modify pulls progress meter to reflect fewer fetches/pulls

	* output \n before warn/die messages when progress bar is present

2011-02-16  Alex Dupuy  <alex.dupuy@mac.com>

	* print "(dirname)" rather than "." for top-level repository
	(where dirname is the last component of the path to top-level)

	* reduce and summarize warning output for branch mismatch
	between master (top-level) and slave repositories

2011-02-15  Alex Dupuy  <alex.dupuy@mac.com>

	* -v to provide full (including suppressed) output, -vv to list
	commands, -vvv to list command status and output.

	* Summarize last message "On:" header if there are many many
	entries.

2011-02-07  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Allow populate to accept arguments for ifpresent repositories
	which should explicitly checked out (partial --with-ifpresent).

	* Populate will now checkout if it sees an emptyish directories at
	the location of where an ifpresent repository should go.

2011-02-04  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* #include support in .gitslave files

	* gits attach failure detection

	* gits --no-hide to prevent hiding of SHAs

	* Contributed .spec file

2010-12-17  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Support flags in gits attach (specifically ifpresent).

	* Actually support documented --with-ifpresent argument.

	* Update man page command line flags

2010-12-17  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Version 1.2 released

	* Add `gits clone` support for easier project initialization.

	* Add `gits detach <directory>` support for easier removal of
          subprojects.

	* Change the default quoting style to fully quote all arguments.
	  Previously, the '$' and '`' characters were not quoted.

	* Add --eval-args to restore the old-style quoting rules.

2010-10-28  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Version 1.1.1 released

	* Deduplicate output summarizing code.  Provide standard
          mechanism to suppress (and show) empty command output.

2010-10-27  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Version 1.1.0 released

	* Add support for `gits remote add` to add new remotes for all
	slaves with the correct relative remote URLs.

	* Add support for `gits archive` to generate a unified tarball
	with slave-relative paths.

	* Full (and documented) support for command substitution
	to allow gits-archive, gits-exec, gits-bundle and friends to
	have output files contain repository specific tokens.

2010-09-20  Seth Robertson  <projectbaka@baka.org>

	* Public 1.0 release
